    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>For this chocolate cake, you’ll need the following ingredients.</p>
    <p><strong>* 3 cups all purpose flour</strong></p>
    <p><strong>* 3 cups granulated sugar</strong></p>
    <p><strong>* 1 1/2 cups unsweetened cocoa powder</strong></p>
    <p><strong>* 1 tablespoon baking soda </strong></p>
    <p><strong>* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder </strong></p>
    <p><strong>* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt</strong></p>
    <p><strong>* 4 large eggs</strong></p>
    <p><strong>* 1 1/2 cups buttermilk</strong></p>
    <p><strong>* 1 1/2 cups warm water (or brewed coffee)</strong></p>
    <p><strong>* 1/2 cup vegetable oil</strong></p>
    <p><strong>* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract</strong></p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Lightly butter three 9-inch cake rounds. Dust with flour or cocoa powder and tap out the excess. Alternatively, you can lightly grease the pans and line with parchment paper.</p>
    <p>2. In a large mixing bowl, mix together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a stand mixer using a low speed until combined.</p>
    <p>3. Add eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, and vanilla. Beat on a low speed until smooth. This should take just a couple of minutes. Be sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl so that everything gets mixed in.</p>
    <p>4. Divide batter evenly amongst the three prepared pans, about 3 cups of batter per pan. Tap the cake pans gently on the counter to allow any bubbles to rise to the top and escape.</p>
    <p>5. Bake for 30-35 minutes in a 350 degree oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>
    <p>6. Cool on wire racks for 15 minutes and then remove the cakes from the pan and place on the wire rack to cool completely.</p>
    <p>7. Frost with your favorite frosting and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>1.For metric measurements, click on the metric tab.  Bake at 176 degrees celsius in three 23 centimeter pans.</p>
    <p>Coffee can be used in place of warm water to enhance the flavor of chocolate. This option is great for dark chocolate lovers.</p>
    <p>The servings on this cake are listed as 3 layers to allow you to use the built-in scaling feature to adjust the recipe larger or smaller depending on how many layers you want to make.</p>
